# About Repo

As of Spring 2020, the repo was coverted into a mono-repo to delineate major blocks of code.

<i>Why</i> Each functional area of the code base has it own major requirements and deliverables. With independent development teams implementing a given set of project features, enabling individual project folders frees the current development team to utilize the best development structure and strategies in their given effort.

Each project folder contains Readme files documenting the purpose of the app, development strategy and implementation path.

## Current Projects

- Maestro / Project Folder 'app-maetro' / Purpose: Main Maestro commandline application
- Verifier / Project Folder 'app-verifier' / Purpose: Compares files outputs to identify file changes when processed through Maestro.

# Maestro Purpose

The purpose of Maestro is to replace the manual procedure creation process for Extravehicular Activities (EVAs, AKA "spacewalks") by NASA\* personnel. The goal of the application is to be able to write EVA procedures as simple YAML files and run `maestro compose` to generate Word or other documents in a standardized procedure format, similar to the Space Shuttle mission "STS-134" procedures found on page `FS 7-20` of [this document](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/539922main_EVA_134_F_A.pdf). More EVAs can be found at the [FOIA archive](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/flightdatafiles/foia_archive.html).

<sub>_\* This is an independent project and is unaffiliated with NASA_</sub>
